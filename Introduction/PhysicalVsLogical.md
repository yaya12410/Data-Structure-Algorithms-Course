Types Of Data Structures:

-Physical:\
1-Array: in an array, all the elements are continuous in memory locations and next to each other, and it can be created either in stack or in heap by having a pointer pointing to it, and we use this data structure when we are sure what is the maximum number of elements we are going to store, if we know the length of the list.\
2-Linked List: it's a complete dynamic data structure and it's a collection of nodes where each node contains data and the link to the next node, the length of this list can grow and reduce dynamically which means they have a dynamic length, and linked lists are always created in the heap.

-Logical:\
1-Stack: LIFO\
2-Queues: FIFO\
3-Trees\
4-Graphs\
5-Hash Table\
Stack and Queues are Linear Data Structures, Trees and Graph are Non-linear Data Structures and Hash Table maybe Linear or Tabular Data Structure.

Any Logical Data Structure is implemented using either Array or Linked List or a combination of both.
