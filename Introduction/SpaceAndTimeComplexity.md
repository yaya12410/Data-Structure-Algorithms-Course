Time Complexity:\
Computers are used to automate and computerize tasks, so we need to know how much time does the machine take to make the task given to it.

n -> means some number of elements not 5 not 10, so for example we say n time was taken to go through the array of n elements, so the time taken depends on the number of elements.\
Searching for a particular number rather it is there or not, the time taking in searching for a particular number depends on how many elements are there.

*To access all the elements, we would write a for loop that goes through all the elements once, then this for a list of n elements the time is order of n -->> O(n).\
In case we are comparing each element with all other elements in a list having n elements so every element is compared with n elements therefore it's around nXn comparison then it takes time of O(n^2).*

In order to do what's mentioned in the previous case the code should be two nested for loop, then mostly when two nested loops exist the time is probably O(n^2).
