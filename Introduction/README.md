Term data is used in many places like: Data Structures, Database, Data Warehouse.\
What is data structure?\
It can be defined as arrangement of data items so it can be utilized efficiently.\
Where?\
Inside the main memory during the execution of a program.
     
In order to process data in the main memory we have to arrange this data first to be easily processed and this arrangement is called data structure.\
The data structure will be on the computer system?\
It will be in the main memory not the disk.\
When the data is large like banks or commercial data and other stuff, the data is organized as database or in the form of tables and the tables are having relationships between them.\
So we can say that the main difference between data structure and database is that the database is a table organized in the disk which means that it's the arrangement of data in the hard disk, while the data structure is the data arrangement but in the main memory!!!

Large size data:\
Data used in business, they will have huge amount of data that will be coming in daily which can be called operational data, but if they doesn't have to be dealt with daily it can be called legacy data or old/historical data.

So the historical data is not only stored on one hard disk but it's stored on array of disks is called DATA WAREHOUSE, which any commercial business most probably have so they can analyze data and put new policies and so on....

The algorithms written to analyze this data is called data mining algorithms.

So to sum it all up:\
Data Structure: In the main memory during the execution.\
Database: On the hard disk, large size data.\
Data Warehouse: Huge data which is inactive now(called big data) stored on array of disks.
