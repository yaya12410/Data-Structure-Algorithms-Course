The main difference between the parameters passing methods is that in passing by value doesn't affect the actual parameters and can be used in case of just comparing or something that doesn't need to change the actual parameters, while in passing by address passes the address of the parameter and the function receives it and stores it into a pointer by which we can later access the actual parameter and change its real values, and the passing by reference method is just as that of by address with its own syntax which is only adding & before the variable in the function definition.
