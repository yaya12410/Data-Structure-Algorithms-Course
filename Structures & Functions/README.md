Classes vs Structs:

1-Struct is used in both C/C++.\
2-Struct's attributes can be accessed using the struct's name and a dot.\
3-Struct can be passed as a pointer of type struct "its type".\
4-On passing struct as a pointer its attributes can only be accessed using arrow ->\
5-Structs only have attributes but have no functions.\
6-Classes exists only in C++.\
7-Classes have attributes which typically are private, and have methods/functions which are typically public.\

Functions: they are used to divide the code into smaller blocks of codes, simpler which makes it more efficient, easier to read and analyze.
